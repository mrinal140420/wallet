## ✨ Tagline  
A beautifully designed student wallet concept — where **parents manage allowances** and **students track spending**.

## 📖 Description  
This project is a **UI/UX design prototype**, not a working financial application.  
It demonstrates the front-end look and feel of a **simple student wallet**:

- Students can view balances  
- Parents can (conceptually) add funds  
- Spending is monitored  
- Limits can be controlled  

This prototype is ideal for presentations, design demonstrations, and future feature planning.
